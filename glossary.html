    <h2>Glossary</h2>
    <h4>Client-side</h4>
    <p>All components in a web application that are displayed on your (or any user’s) screen, and how the web application handles any user interactions.</p>

    <h4>Comma-separated values file (.csv file)</h4>
    <p>A plaintext file that contains text representing some sort of data. For more information on .csv files, check out </p>
    <a href="csv-files.html">What are .csv files?</a>

    <h4>Local device</h4>
    <p>The current computer, phone, or other machine you are using. If something is downloaded locally, it is only downloaded to the local device, and not to a shared folder on the web/cloud.</p>
    <h5>Editing locally</h5>
    <p>Editing a file only on your local device, such that any changes made are not reflected in any shared online folders in the web or cloud.</p>
    
    <h4>Open-source software</h4>
    <p>Software whose original source code is made publicly and freely available for others to see and access; other developers may use and/or modify this code as they see fit.</p>
    
    <h4>Plaintext</h4>
    <p>Any text that is not specially formatted, or written in a coding language; the simplest way of representing digital text.</p>

    <h4>Repository</h4>
    <p>A container for or collection of files, often code, that are related to a project. In GitHub, repositories also track each file’s history and changes made over time. Often called a “repo” for short.</p>
    <h5>Cloning a repository</h5>
    <p>Creating an exact local copy of the original repository (and all of its files) onto your local device. Also downloads the entire project history onto your local device. This allows you to work on and edit the code offline (without internet connection).</p>
    <h5>Forking a repository</h5>
    <p>Making an exact copy of the original repository (and all of its files) into your personal account, allowing you to change files without affecting the original source code.</p>
    <h5>Pushing to a repository</h5>
    <p>Uploading local changes to files in a repository to the remote repository (the shared one on the web). Transfers commits from the local repository to the remote one.</p>
    <h5>Remote repository</h5>
    <p>A repository which stores source code online (e.g. on a server, and not your local device). Remote repositories are accessible to multiple users at the same time, and act as a centralized location for sharing and collaborating on the code.</p>

    <h4>Server-side</h4>
    <p>All code and logic that does not happen on the client-side, including but not limited to retrieving and updating information from databases, identity authentication, and more.</p>

    <h4>Source code</h4>
    <p>A set of instructions/code written in a computer language that runs a program or application.</p>

    <h4>Version control system</h4>
    <p>A tool that allows you to track changes to one or more files over time, e.g. GitHub.</p>
