# Setting up R and RStudio

R is a free software development language commonly used for statistical analysis. 
The code for MyFavoriteAlbums’ analysis is written in R. In order to modify or add on additional 
features, you’ll need to download RStudio, a coding environment that supports R.

Navigate to the [R and RStudio download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), 
which contains instructions on how to download both R and RStudio. 
Make sure to download the correct version for your operating system.
