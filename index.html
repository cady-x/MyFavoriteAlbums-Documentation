    <h2>What is MyFavoriteAlbums?</h2>
    <p>MyFavoriteAlbums is a web platform that can analyze and filter user data on music taste and preference.
      Users have the option to filter for number one albums by year (or range of years), see total and average ratings for each artist, find top albums by year,
      see statistics on vinyl ownership, and compare different artists’ album ratings over time. MyFavoriteAlbums comes with a user-friendly website
      that has intuitive controls to help users navigate through the site. Additionally, users can generate multiple different visual models of their music-listening statistics.
