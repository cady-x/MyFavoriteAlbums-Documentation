# Setting up Shiny

Shiny is an R package which allows you to host your own website. 
For example, Shiny can help you publish your modifications to MyFavoriteAlbums to the internet.

### Installing Shiny:
If you havenâ€™t installed the Shiny package, open an R session, connect to the internet, and run
```install.packages("shiny")```

### Running Shiny
Shiny apps are contained in a single script called ```app.R```. 
The script ```app.R``` lives in a directory (for example, ```newdir/```) and the app can be run with ```runApp("newdir")```.
